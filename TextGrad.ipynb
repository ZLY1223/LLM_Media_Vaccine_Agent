            "Roughly one in five adults younger than 65 and one in four seniors will go on to develop another health condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19 exposure, new CDC data shows. Why it matters: The data quantifies just how prevalent COVID aftereffects may be in the general population. Those conditions include kidney failure, skeletomuscular conditions, and blood clots and other vascular issues. Zoom in: The study analyzed more than 353,000 de-identified electronic health records from the Cerner Real-World database between March 2020 to November 2021. Researchers found those who've recovered from a COVID-19 infection have twice the risk for developing pulmonary embolism or respiratory conditions. Patients 65 and older in the study were at increased risk for neurologic conditions and four of five mental health conditions.\n",
            "Article 2: Moderna seeks FDA authorization for 4th dose of COVID shot\n",
            "Drugmaker Moderna asked the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday to authorize a fourth shot of its COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose for all adults. The request is broader than rival pharmaceutical company Pfizers request earlier this week for the regulator to approve a booster shot for all seniors. In a press release, the company said its request for approval for all adults was made to provide flexibility to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and medical providers to determine the appropriate use of a second booster dose of the mRNA vaccine, including for those at higher risk of COVID-19 due to age or comorbidities. U.S. officials have been laying the groundwork to deliver additional booster doses to shore up the vaccines protection against serious disease and death from COVID-19.\n",
            "Article 3: COVID-19 hospital admissions, deaths expected to keep climbing in the us amid resurgence\n",
            "A growing number of COVID-19 positive patients are entering hospitals. Amidst the nation's latest resurgence in COVID-19 infections, new forecast models used by the CDC show that daily hospital admission levels and new virus-related deaths in the U. S. are projected to continue increasing over the next four weeks. The forecast comes as a growing number of COVID-19 positive patients are entering hospitals and requiring care each day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are now more than 20,000 virus-positive Americans currently receiving care in the U. S., the data shows the highest total number of patients hospitalized since mid-March. On average, more than 2,500 virus-positive Americans are entering the hospital each day -- a total that has increased by 18.1% in the last week.\n",
            "Article 4: Biden Administration launches national research plan to understand and treat long COVID\n",
            "President Joe Biden on Tuesday directed the Health and Human Services Department to lead a federal effort to research the diagnosis and treatment of long Covid. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra on Tuesday said he will lead a national council that includes the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs and Labor. The council will share information in real time on how to prevent, detect and treat long Covid, Becerra said during a White House Covid briefing. Scientists and doctors still do not fully understand why some people who contract Covid experience symptoms months later, sometimes with debilitating consequences for daily life. These symptoms include difficulty breathing, fatigue, problems concentrating, body aches, tingling sensations and mood changes, among others.\n",
            "Article 5: Republican explains why it's okay that hundreds of kids have died 'with' COVID-19\n",
            "Rep. Guy Reschenthaler is a Republican out of Pennsylvanias 14th Congressional District. Guy is one of the many white guys who voted to overturn our democratically decided 2020 election. Rep. Reschenthaler is also the GOP big-brain that looked at the murder of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and said the murder of George Floyd means we should invest more in police departments. Prior to that, while running for Congress, Reschenthaler is the fellow that wrote a forward for the racist, homophobic, Islamophobic tome written by disgraced former Navy SEAL Carl Higbie. Guy isnt a particularly good guy and he doesnt seem to have very good ideas in general. What is Reschenthalers new big idea?\n",

            "1. **Balanced Evidence Extraction**: Identify and mention at least two specific data points, statistics, or expert opinions from the articles that support your decision. Include direct quotes or paraphrased key points that clearly demonstrate both the health benefits and potential risks of vaccination, such as protection against severe illness or concerns about side effects.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Explicit Counterargument Section**: List at least two factors or arguments presented in the articles that might challenge your decision and provide evidence-based responses to these points. Explore reasons for vaccine hesitancy, such as mistrust in pharmaceutical companies or cultural beliefs, and address these concerns with evidence.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Contextual Sensitivity**: Highlight any recent developments, public health policies, or societal attitudes mentioned in the articles that are relevant to your decision. Discuss how these factors, along with your demographic and regional context, influence your decision.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Nuanced Quantitative Reasoning Framework**: Explain how the evidence from the articles influences your likelihood percentages. Use a nuanced approach by weighting different factors, such as personal beliefs and media influence, to provide a balanced prediction. Clarify the reasoning behind both likelihood percentages.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Bias Awareness and Mitigation**: Recognize and mitigate any inherent biases towards vaccination. Consider a wider range of perspectives and adjust for biases in the data to ensure a fair analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Language Flexibility**: Use language that reflects the complexity of the decision-making process. Acknowledge uncertainty and the validity of different viewpoints, using terms like \"conclusively demonstrates\" or \"irrefutably proves\" when appropriate.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Incorporate Diverse Perspectives**: Explicitly require the integration of diverse perspectives, including those skeptical of vaccination. Analyze articles or opinions from various sources to represent a spectrum of views on vaccination.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Emotional and Relational Considerations**: Integrate emotional appeals by discussing how vaccination protects loved ones and contributes to societal well-being, while also considering emotional reasons for not vaccinating, such as fear of side effects.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Structured Reasoning Format**: Start with a summary of your prior beliefs, including any initial hesitations or concerns. Follow with evidence from the articles, counterarguments and responses, and finally, your conclusion with likelihood percentages. Ensure all reasoning is explicitly stated without relying on implied or omitted content.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Decisive Language for Decision-Making**: Use assertive language to convey a firm decision, such as \"I have decided\" or \"I am certain,\" especially when the evidence strongly supports one option.\n",
            "\n",
            "11. **Specific Benefits and Justifications**: Include at least three specific benefits or reasons for your decision, such as herd immunity, personal protection, and contributions to public health, to provide a stronger justification.\n",
            "\n",
            "12. **Counterargument Refutation**: Explicitly address and refute at least two common counterarguments or concerns about vaccination with evidence-based responses.\n",
            "\n",
            "13. **Data and Statistics Integration**: Incorporate at least one relevant data point or statistic about the effectiveness or safety of the COVID-19 vaccine to strengthen your reasoning.\n",
            "\n",
            "14. **Evidence Weighting**: Prioritize evidence that is most directly related to the decision, ensuring that the prediction is well-supported.\n",
            "\n",
            "15. **Feedback Integration**: Review past predictions and outcomes to refine your reasoning process, identifying patterns or errors, and adjusting future reasoning accordingly.\n",
