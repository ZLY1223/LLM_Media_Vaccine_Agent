            "It is now about as official as it can be: The United States has reached at least one million pandemic deaths after a COVID-19 response that began incompetently, that was dismissed by a significant chunk of the nation as unnecessary, and that would eventually morph into a new \"culture war\" that would turn every urged safety precaution into a battle between medical professionals who had spent decades preparing for new pandemic and Republicans who declared each one of those things to be tyranny. When the Trump-led federal government was slow to respond, states took the lead to temporarily close public spaces and businesses in those parts of the United States in which hospitals were becoming overwhelmed.\n",
            "Article 2: Moderna says its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in kids under 6\n",
            "Moderna announced on Wednesday that its COVID-19 vaccine produced a safe, robust immune response in kids ages 6 months to 6 years. The company said it will submit its data to the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization \"in the coming weeks.\" In the KidCOVE clinical trial, the vaccine was about 44% effective at preventing infections in the younger age group (6 months to 2-year-olds) and 38% effective at preventing COVID-19 infections among the older age group (2- to 6-year-olds). \"The efficacy seems a little bit low, it's in the 40% range for this age group,\" Dr. John Torres, NBC senior medical correspondent, told TODAY. \"But what they said in the study about 7,000 children was that nobody had serious disease, nobody was hospitalized and nobody died from it.\n",
            "Article 3: Large survey finds who may be at highest risk for long COVID\n",
            "It's a question everyone wants answered: Who is more likely to develop long COVID-19, the debilitating symptoms that can linger for weeks, months or even longer, after an infection? A new unpublished study from 23andMe is part of a growing body of research shedding light on who experiences post-COVID conditions and why. The survey, which was voluntary and relied on people self-reporting symptoms, had several major findings, including that women were far more likely to experience long-term symptoms, as were people with a prior diagnosis of depression or anxiety. More than half of people who reported a diagnosis of long COVID had a history of cardiometabolic disease, such as heart attacks or diabetes. The 23andMe survey included 100,000 people who reported a diagnosis of COVID.\n",
            "Article 4: Study Reveals how COVID-19 infections can set off Massive Inflammation in the Body\n",
            "From the early days of the pandemic, doctors noticed that in severe cases of Covid-19 the ones that landed people in the hospital on ventilators with shredded lungs most of the internal wreckage wasnt being directly inflicted by the virus itself but by a blizzard of immune reactions triggered by the body to fight the infection. Researchers knew that these so-called cytokine storms were damaging, but they didnt know why the SARS-CoV-2 virus seemed to be so good at setting them off. A new study published Wednesday in the journal Nature is helping to explain how these immune overreactions happen to Covid-19 patients.\n",
            "Article 5: Experts worry about how US will see next COVID surge coming\n",
            "As coronavirus infections rise in some parts of the world, experts are watching for a potential new COVID-19 surge in the U.S. and wondering how long it will take to detect. Despite disease monitoring improvements over the last two years, they say, some recent developments dont bode well: As more people take rapid COVID-19 tests at home, fewer people are getting the gold-standard tests that the government relies on for case counts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will soon use fewer labs to look for new variants. Health officials are increasingly focusing on hospital admissions, which rise only after a surge has arrived. A wastewater surveillance program remains a patchwork that cannot yet be counted on for the data needed to understand coming surges.\n",
